Then came a friend's disturbing dream and with it Folman's need to excavate the truth of the war in Lebanon and answer the crucial question: What was he doing during the hours of slaughter at Sabra and Shatila? Stunningly original in form, Waltz with Bashir follows Folman's journey deep into the darkness of Beirut. Drawing on the stories of other soldiers and his own returning fragments of memory, Folman painfully and candidly pieces together the war and his place in it: the senselessness of the soldiers' orders; the fear that pervades every moment; the casual bloodshed of civilians, culminating in the massacres themselves. The result is a graphic novel that is as damning as it is beautiful. An indictment of violence of extraordinary power, Waltz with Bashir will take its place.","245a":"Waltz with Bashir :","035a":["ocn318317344","ocn223884851"],"245b":"a Lebanon war story : [a graphic novel] \/","100a":"Folman, Ari.","245c":"Ari Folman, David Polonsky.","9060":"DLC","043a":["a-le---","a-is---"],"650a":["Soldiers","Sabra and Shatila Massacre, Lebanon, 1982"],"020a":["9780805086737 (hardcover)","0805086730 (hardcover)","9780805088922 (pbk.)","080508892X (pbk.)"],"250a":"1st U.S. ed.","040a":"DLC","040c":"DLC","040d":["BTCTA","BAKER","YDXCP","C#P","BWX","WIM","CDX","NAB","IXA"],"650v":["Biography","Comic books, strips, etc.","Personal narratives, Israeli","Comic books, strips, etc."],"0822":"22","650z":"Israel","700a":"Polonsky, David.","655a":"Graphic novels.","300a":"117 p. :","651a":"Lebanon","300b":"col. ill. ;","300c":"27 cm.","score_total":"1","651v":"Comic books, strips, etc.","651x":["History","Atrocities"],"651y":"Israeli intervention, 1982-1984","600a":"Folman, Ari","010a":"  2008023322","260a":"New York :","260b":"Metropolitan Books,","050a":"DS87.53","260c":"c2009.","050b":".F65 2009","082a":"956.9204\/4"}},"55":{"holding_libs":["WID"],"lcsh":["Comic books, strips, etc.","Fictitious characters Comic books, strips, etc.","Fairy tales Comic books, strips, etc.","Fables Comic books, strips, etc.","Fantasy comic books, strips, etc.","Fantasy comics books, strips, etc. Fiction.","New York (N.Y.)
