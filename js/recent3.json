Its leader was skilled in hand-to-hand combat and with more than a passing interest in the occult, specifically black magic, one nasty customer. Rather than be taken by Canary or the law, she went to her death, vowing she would get revenge on Canary and her own former gang members. Now, a year to the day later, death stalks those gang members, and Canary must turn to her friend Zatanna to help investigate. Two of comics top talents, writer Paul Dini (DETECTIVE COMICS, BATMAN: ARKHAM CITY) and artist Joe Quinones (WEDNESDAY COMICS, TEEN TITANS GO!), bring two of DC Universe's brightest stars togetherin this stunning tale of magic and mayhem\"--","245a":"Black Canary and Zatanna :","245b":"Bloodspell \/","035a":["(PromptCat)99961784272","ocn868300491"],"520c":"Provided by publisher.","245c":"Paul Dini, writer ; Joe Quinones, artist ; Dave McCaig, colorist.","100a":"Dini, Paul,","9060":"DLC","100e":"author.","6552":"gsafd","3362":["rdacontent","rdacontent"],"016a":"016649752","246a":"Bloodspell","650a":["COMICS & GRAPHIC NOVELS \/ Superheroes.","Graphic novels","Superhero comic books, strips, etc."],"020a":["9781401210540 (hardback)","1401210546 (hardback)"],"040a":"DLC","084a":"CGN004080","040b":"eng","040c":"DLC","040d":["YDXCP","BTCTA","BDX","ORX","CNEDM","UKMGB","CVA"],"040e":"rda","3372":"rdamedia","0822":"23","650z":"United States.","700a":["Quinones, Joe,","McCaig, Dave,"],"655a":["Graphic novels.","Comic books, strips, etc."],"336a":["text","still image"],"700e":["illustrator.","illustrator."],"300a":"(unpaged) :","300b":"color illustrations ;","300c":"27 cm","3382":"rdacarrier","0152":"bnb","337a":"unmediated","264a":"New York :","264b":"DC Comics,","010a":"  2014001615","264c":"[2014]","042a":"pcc","490a":"Black Canary and Zatanna","050a":"PN6727.D57","050b":"B57 2014","082a":"741.5\/973","0162":"Uk"}},"12":{"holding_libs":["HYL"],"lcsh":["Short stories, Korean Comic books, strips, etc.","Graphic novels Korea (South)."],"pages_numeric":203,"score_holding_libs":1,"id_isbn":["9788952712776","8952712773","8952712757","97889527127"],"id":"D7C8BAEF-BF0E-E4F7-C86B-C05A7469C413","collection":"hollis_catalog","title_sort":"Manhwa ro pon\u016dn Han\u02bcguk tanp\u02bby\u014fn munhak s\u014fnjip","call_num":["PN6790.K64 M38 2001 .2"],"height":"23 cm","title_link_friendly":"manhwa-ro-ponn-hanguk-tanpyn-munhak","creator":["Kim, Tong-hwa, 1950-",".",".",".","."],"pub_date":"2001","loc_call_num_subject":["Language and literature -- Collections of general literature -- Comic books, strips, etc. -- By region or country"],"pub_location":"S\u014ful-si","pages":"203 p","loc_call_num_sort_order":[8410727],"data_source":"harvard_edu","dataset_tag":"harvard_edu_catalog_bibs_1429434997","shelfrank":1,"title":"Manhwa ro pon\u016dn Han\u02bcguk tanp\u02bby\u014fn munhak s\u014fnjip","language":"Korean (use for related lang. and dial.)","id_inst":"011881868","id_oclc":"ocn312236577","height_numeric":23,"format":"Book","publisher":"Sigongsa","pub_date_numeric":2001,"source_record":{"8806":["100-01","245-02","250-03","260-04","505-05","653-00","700-06","700-07","700-08","700-09","700-10"],"988a":"20090304","2506":"880-03","245a":"Manhwa ro pon\u016dn Han\u02bcguk tanp\u02bby\u014fn munhak s\u014fnjip.","035a":"ocn312236577","100a":"Kim, Tong-hwa,","245c":"Kim Tong-hwa.","9060":"MH","043a":"a-ko---","100d":"1950-","245n":"2 \/","7006":["880-06","880-07","880-08","880-09","880-10"],"505a":"Nalgae \/ Yi Sang -- Han\u02bcgugin \/ S\u014fnu Hwi -- Y\u014fngma \/ Kim Tong-li -- P\u014fng\u014fri Samnyongi \/ Na To-hyang.","650a":["Short stories, Korean","Graphic novels"],"880a":["\uae40\ub3d9\ud654,","\ub9cc\ud654\ub85c\ubcf4\ub294\ud55c\uad6d\ub2e8\ud3b8\ubb38\ud559\uc120\uc9d1.","\ucd08\ud310.","\uc11c\uc6b8\uc2dc :","\ub0a0\uac1c \/ \uc774\uc0c1 -- \ud55c\uad6d\uc778 \/ \uc120\uc6b0\ud718 -- \ubd89\uc740\uc0b0 \/ \uae40\ub3d9\uc778 -- \uc5ed\ub9c8 \/ \uae40\ub3d9\ub9ac -- \ubc99\uc5b4\ub9ac\uc0bc\ub8e1\uc774 \/ \ub098\ub3c4\ud5a5.","\ub9cc\ud654","\uc774\uc0c1,","\uc120\uc6b0\ud718,","\uae40\ub3d9\uc778,","\uae40\ub3d9\ub9ac,","\ub098\ub3c4\ud5a5,"],"880b":"\uc2dc\uacf5\uc0ac,","880c":["\uae40\ub3d9\ud654.","2001."],"020a":["9788952712776 (v.2)","8952712773 (v.2)","8952712757 (set)","9788952712752 (set)"],"880d":["1950-","1910-1937.","1922-1986.","1900-1951.","1913-1995.","1902-1927."],"250a":"Ch\u02bbop\u02bban.","040a":"HMY","040c":"HMY","880n":"2 \/","880t":["\ub0a0\uac1c.","\ud55c\uad6d\uc778.","\ubd89\uc740\uc0b0.","\uc5ed\ub9c8.","\ubc99\uc5b4\ub9ac\uc0bc\ub8e1\uc774."],"650v":"Comic books, strips, etc.","toc":"Nalgae \/ Yi Sang -- Han\u02bcgugin \/ S\u014fnu Hwi -- Y\u014fngma \/ Kim Tong-li -- P\u014fng\u014fri Samnyongi \/ Na To-hyang","650z":"Korea (South)","700a":["Yi, Sang,","S\u014fnu, Hwi,","Kim, Tong-in,","Kim, Tongni,","Na, To-hyang,"],"2606":"880-04","700d":["1910-1937.","1922-1986.","1900-1951.","1913-1995.","1902-1927."],"300a":"203 p. :","300b":"ill. ;","300c":"23 cm.","700t":["Nalgae.","Han\u02bcgugin.","Pulg\u016dn san.","Y\u014fngma.","P\u014fng\u014fri Samnyongi."],"2456":"880-02","1006":"880-01","260a":"S\u014ful-si :","260b":"Sigongsa,","260c":"2001.","090a":"PN6790.K64","090b":"M38 2001 vol.2","5056":"880-05"}},"13":{"holding_libs":["WID"],"lcsh":["Jewish children Comic books, strips, etc.","Mezuzah Juvenile fiction.","Comic books, strips, etc. Religious aspects Judaism.

No one has told the story of comic art in its own medium, until now. In Masterful Marks, top illustrators--including Drew Friedman, Nora Krug, Denis Kitchen, and Peter Kuper--reveal how sixteen visionary cartoonists overcame massive financial, political, and personal challenges to create a new form of art that now defines our world. Superhero comics didn't exist until two teenagers from Cleveland created the first superhero of all time: Superman. Advertising artist Theodor Geisel released his first book in 1937 as Dr. Seuss--and children's literature was never the same. Charles M. Schulz's perseverance and passion gave the world Peanuts, the world's most famous comic strip. Featuring these tales, and profiling such giants as Walt Disney, Robert Crumb, and the creators of MAD, Tintin, and manga, Masterful Marks illustrates how graphic storytelling became such a rich and popular medium. Masterful Marks is a stunning portrait of the comic art's aesthetic heritage and a powerful story of how creative vision can change the world\"--","\"Masterful Marks is a first-of-its-kind collection of graphic biographies of the visionary artists who pioneered the modern era of comics, drawn by today's foremost illustrators and edited by the award-winning creator of the cult-favorite BLAB art books, Monte Beauchamp. In Masterful Marks: Cartoonists Who Changed the World, sixteen award-winning illustrators shed light on the lives of the pioneer artists who most influenced them--and who created the world of modern comic art.

No one has told the story of comic art in its own medium, until now. In Masterful Marks, top illustrators--including Drew Friedman, Nora Krug, Denis Kitchen, and Peter Kuper--reveal how sixteen visionary cartoonists overcame massive financial, political, and personal challenges to create a new form of art that now defines our world. Superhero comics didn't exist until two teenagers from Cleveland created the first superhero of all time: Superman. Advertising artist Theodor Geisel released his first book in 1937 as Dr. Seuss--and children's literature was never the same. Charles M. Schulz's perseverance and passion gave the world Peanuts, the world's most famous comic strip. Featuring these tales, and profiling such giants as Walt Disney, Robert Crumb, and the creators of MAD, Tintin, and manga, Masterful Marks illustrates how graphic storytelling became such a rich and popular medium. Masterful Marks is a stunning portrait of the comic art's aesthetic heritage and a powerful story of how creative vision can change the world\"--","\"Masterful Marks is a first-of-its-kind collection of graphic biographies of the visionary artists who pioneered the modern era of comics, drawn by today's foremost illustrators and edited by the award-winning creator of the cult-favorite BLAB art books, Monte Beauchamp.
