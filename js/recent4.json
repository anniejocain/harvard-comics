Two stories co-starring the unbearably lucky Gladstone, including the epic \"Race to the South Seas,\" as Donald and Gladstone try to win Uncle Scrooge's favor by being the first to rescue him from a desert island. Two Christmas stories, including \"The Golden Christmas Tree,\" one of Barks's most fantastic stories that pits him and the nephews against a witch who wants to destroy all the Christmas trees in the world. In other stories, Donald plays a TV quiz show contestant and ends up encased in a giant barrel of \"Shaky-Jell,\" a truant officer who matches wits with his nephews, and a ranch hand who outwits cattle rustlers.","245a":"Lost in the Andes \/","035a":["(PromptCat)99946896513","ocn751802841"],"100a":"Barks, Carl,","245c":"by Carl Barks.","9060":"OCLC","100d":"1901-2000.","6552":"sears","016a":"015846852","505g":["The adventures:","The short stories:","The gags:"],"246a":["Walt Disney's Donald Duck :","Donald Duck :"],"246b":["\"lost in the Andes\"","\"lost in the Andes\""],"650a":["Donald Duck (Fictitious character)","Dewey (Fictitious character : Disney)","Huey (Fictitious character : Disney)","Louie (Fictitious character : Disney)","McDuck, Scrooge (Fictitious character)","Ducks","Uncles","Nephews","Comic books, strips, etc.","Graphic novels."],"020a":["9781606994740 (hbk.) :","1606994743 (hbk.) :"],"246i":"Title appears on item as:","020c":["$24.99","$24.99"],"040a":"UKMGB","040b":"eng","040c":"UKMGB","040d":["BKX","BTCTA","YDXCP","VHP","GK8","BWX","GZD","HCO","ZCU","BDX","YW6","CGU"],"505t":["Lost in the Andes! --","The golden Christmas tree --","Race to the South Seas! --","Voodoo hoodoo.","Toyland --","The crazy quiz show --","Truant officer Donald --","Donald Duck's worst nightmare --","Pizen Spring Dude Ranch --","Rival beachcombers --","The sunken yacht --","Managing the eco system --","Plenty of pets.","Jumping to conclusions --","The true test --","Ornaments on the way --","Too fit to fit --","Sleepy sitters --","Slippery shine --","Tunnel vision."],"650v":["Comic books, strips, etc.","Comic books, strips, etc.","Comic books, strips, etc.","Comic books, strips, etc.","Comic books, strips, etc.","Comic books, strips, etc.","Comic books, strips, etc.","Comic books, strips, etc."],"toc":["The adventures: Lost in the Andes! -- The golden Christmas tree -- Race to the South Seas! -- Voodoo hoodoo.","The short stories: Toyland -- The crazy quiz show -- Truant officer Donald -- Donald Duck's worst nightmare -- Pizen Spring Dude Ranch -- Rival beachcombers -- The sunken yacht -- Managing the eco system -- Plenty of pets.","The gags: Jumping to conclusions -- The true test -- Ornaments on the way -- Too fit to fit -- Sleepy sitters -- Slippery shine -- Tunnel vision"],"0822":"23","655a":["Comic books, strips, etc.","Comic books, strips, etc."],"300a":"204 p. :","300b":"chiefly col. ill. ;","300c":"26 cm.","0152":"bnb","260a":"Seattle, WA :","490a":"Walt Disney's Donald Duck","260b":"Fantagraphics Books,","050a":"PN6728.D6","260c":"c2011.","050b":"B38 2011","082a":"741.5973","0162":"Uk"}},"13":{"holding_libs":["WID"],"lcsh":["Women spies Comic books, strips, etc. Fiction.","Ambassadors Europe Comic books, strips, etc. Fiction.","Americans Europe Comic books, strips, etc. Fiction.","Graphic novels.","Suspense fiction, French Translations into English.","Young adult fiction, French Translations into English."],"score_holding_libs":1,"id_isbn":["9781905460724","1905460724","9781849180245","97818491"],"id":"1BFF2199-7539-13BF-F602-D9A903E8202D","collection":"hollis_catalog","title_sort":"Lady S","height":"26 cm","title_link_friendly":"lady-s","creator":["Hamme, van, 1939-","Aymond, Philippe."],"pub_date":"2008","pub_location":"Ashford","pages":"v","data_source":"harvard_edu","dataset_tag":"harvard_edu_catalog_bibs_1429434997","shelfrank":1,"title":"Lady S","language":"English","id_inst":"011814032","id_oclc":"ocn317290164","height_numeric":26,"format":"Book","publisher":"Cinebook","pub_date_numeric":2008,"source_record":{"988a":"20090124","899a":"415_565426","245a":"Lady S. \/","035a":"ocn317290164","100a":"Hamme,","245c":"drawing and colour work, Philippe Aymond ; script, Jean Van Hamme.","9060":"MH","043a":"e------","100c":"van,","100d":"1939-","505a":"1.
